- Cele can be swapped for Viper (higher dps), Trailblazer (higher tank), or Dire (budget). If using Dire, change runes to Balthazar. Alchemy -> Inventions may be worth testing due to the number of turrets in this build.

- Rotation:
  1. Use auto-attacks off cooldown. Drop your turrets and group mobs near them.
2. As in 1, + spam F2 (Flamethrower Toolbelt) off cooldown.
3. As in 2, + occasionally drop Flamethrower for a moment to use Pistol 4.
Once comfortable, experiment with removing 1-2 turrets and using Elixirs like Elixir U and Elixir B in their place. 

_Note: as we re-use the axe, put the more expensive torment sigil on the axe, asyou only need one)_
